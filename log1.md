  Thoughts -  Starting 100 Days of Code again. Life got away from me for trying to hard to balance this with getting certifications in my IT job. Eventually I will     be switching over to software full-time. In the mean time, I'll be learning web development and then do some freelance work to get better at software and earn some money on the side. But as of now I am starting with HTML and CSS with the Modern HTML and CSS course from Brad Traversy.
