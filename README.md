# 100DaysOfCode
A collection of logs for doing the 100 Days of Code. 

Days 1 thru 4 are displayed in Instagram. The rest will be shown here.

## Day 5 - Learning CSS
Started to actual go into CSS. Went over fonts, colors, borders, and started on backgrounds. Learned about changing font families and applying size and line height. Went over the 3 ways to use color - name, RGB values and most importantly Hex values. Went over borders with their 3 parts - color, wwidth, and style. Started to go over backgrounds. Went over basic colors for backgrounds and how to apply images. Using no-repeat to not repeat the image and center center/cover to center the image and to display the full image if it's a large or small one.

## Day 6 - Learning CSS II
Wrapped up understanding backgrounds with learning the attachment propety so you can have an image be fixed onto the background. Started going over one of the most important parts of CSS - the Box Model. This provides the proper spacing around your elements and their borders. You have your given element, then padding between it and it's border. After that, you have you margin spacing around the border of the element itself. SLeanred the theory, but will learn the proper usage tomorrow.

## Day 7 - Learning CSS III
Finished up learning about the box model of margins and padding. Applying values to all sides, combining like values for top and bottom with left and right. Went over alignment in CSS. Learned the use of the container class with a max-width and auto margins are used to center your various boxes. Learned the tex align property to align my text in anyway that I need; mainly used center. Learned about the basic float, before learning about using CSS grid and flex box. When you float something, need to remember to set a width with percentage, and set the box sizing to border-box to prevent combining of values. And ended with, always remember to clear your floats to prevent the overlapping of elements. 

## Day 8 - Learning CSS IV
Learned about styling links and buttons and that there will be times to style links as buttons using btn as the class name. Went over styling and setting up navigation menus. When doing an overall nav menu with floats, rememebr to use the overflow propety so the floats do not collapse the background. 

## Day 9 - Hotel BT
Started on the first HTML and CSS project called Hotel BT. This project using basic HTML and CSS nothing special. Added the project images to the project folder. Created the 3 HTML pages used for the project - index, about and contact. Added the main CSS style sheet called main that will hold all the main styling for the project. Created the HTML and the CSS for the logo that will link to the homepage andthe navigation menu to the 3 different pages of the website.

## Day 10 - Hotel BT II
Worked on the Showcase, Home info and Features sections for the website. Created the HMTL for these sections along with JS script to Font Awesome to use their icons. Created thier CSS rules for these sections minus Features. Having these sections, will have their own styling rules while also having utility classes that I will use throughout the project. Doing project like this shows me a better understanding of HTML and vanilla CSS and how to use them. With more projects, will provide a better understanding of web development.

## Day 11 - Hotel BT III
Styled the features section of the homepage. Used floats on the box div's while providing padding and background colors to the boxes. Created the HTML for the footer section and added the CSS for the footer section. Centered the text in the footer while also adding text color and background color. Added the clr class to clear the floats from the boxes so that the spacing for the background in the footer gets its given size. Gotta love the the use of floats and the clearing of the floats.

## Day 12 - Hotel BT - Final
Finally wrapped up the Hotel Bt website. I completed the HTML and CSS for the about and contact page. Doing this project has shown how to create a simple website. Shows the general way of doing websote developement. Even though, the CSS was simple CSS with floats which make its interesting. The pages use alot of the same parts and classes, which makes it easier for devleoping the site. The more practice I get form these projects, will help to understand web development and with the devleopment itself.

## Day 13 - Responsive Design
Started on the section for Responsive Design. Anytime you build a website add or app, you need to think of the different screen sizes that will run saide site and app. Learned the Mobile First method to learning repsonsive redesgin. Learned what nedia queries and how to use them. Besides setting a max-width, you can also set min-width, min-height, and max-height. You can also set a media to be a screen size between a max-width and min-width. On a seprate ote, got a newer iPAd at work since we are doing away with Apple products. 

## Day 14 - Bowling
Nothing wrong with hanging out with friends who are family. It's needed.

## Day 15 - Responsive Design II
Went over the different units used in reponsive design - em, rem, viewport height/vh and viewport width/vw. Rem are relative units based on the root element. The root element that is used is the HTML element. The given pixels the root element uses is 16 pixels. Rem is ahwole lot esier to use and understand then using em units. Em units is based on the sizing of the parent element/container. Using em units can cause issues with spacing and sizing for nested elements. Vh units and Vw units both have 100 per browser. VH is the most common of the 2 since you will laways have websites going across the screen. Vh units are also great with the creation and styling of landing pages. Understanding these provide a better understanding with media queries to understand and use responsive design. 

## Day 16 Hotel BT IV / Flexbox Design
After learning abiout responsive design, the Hoel BT project got resposnive for screen sizes that are tablet size and smaller. Added a mobile css file, which includes all of the responsive style rules for the smaller queen size. Added a media attribute of screena and max-width of 768 pixels, for the screen sizes. Basically lessened spacing of the margins and padding for the smaller screen sizes, removed floats so the tiems would be stacked neatly, added some bottrom border lines for the different list items, and when items are stacked made sure their widths would be 100% across the screen. After that, I went of the first mondern CSS layout known as flex box. Flex box or flex for short, replaces floats to center items along the main and cross axis of the flex container. You can set flex items to wrap to the next line when the screen is smaller. You can set flex itmes to shrink when the scree gets smaller. You can also set the flex items to fill the width and or ehight of the flex container by setting it's grow. The geeral idea of the flex box is an amazing one. Next step, is to create a project that will show flex in action along with provide a better understanding of flex box. 

## Day 17 - EdgeLedger
Started the the next project called EdgeLEdger. The site is for a made up financial company. Its the project that showcases how to use flexbox instead of the crazy use of floats. Created the HTML for the header section of the site. This project will not have seperate pages until you get to thr blog portion. Other links will take you various parts of the compnay page. HAve 2 different style pages - main and utilities. One is for the main styling of the website and the other for common use styling like the button class for example. Styled the navbar while floating the logo to the left and navbar to the right. Added an image to the background with the content in the center. 

## Day 18 - EdgeLedger II with Top Golf
Today was like any other day: code code code. But seriously, before learning more about CSS cdoe I went to Top Golf. Hanging with fri-amly (friend family) can provide much laughter and release. Besides seeing more flexbox styling, I learned about overlays and the before pseudo-selector. Providing an overlay, is basically like tinting the background while using a z-index to bring the content forward in front of the tinited background. The more I see and use flexbox the better understanding I'm getting and why it's much easier then dealing with floats and trying to clear them. 

## Day 19 - CSS Grid and Moving Forward
Today I decide to stop theFlex project i was on and move on to the CSS Grid subsystem. The Grid sytem uses a 2D mapping system with columns and rows to determine layouts. CSS Grid is alot more powerful then flex, bur for me it seems alot more easier. As so far, it is. I moved onto Grid, because ater this Grif subsection I am moving straight onto JavaScript to get a hand on on that and more. 

## Day 20 CSS Grid II aka Final Style
Today wraps up the basics of CSS and HTML. I wrapped up learning CSS grid and how it and Flexbox both can provide great ways to display your webpage's content to the user. Css Grid provides a great way to display your content using template areas since it visually sets up how you want the layout to look, while using media queries sets the beheavre for different screen sizes. Over all both Grid and Flexbox will be great for laying out content. Reason why I call this the Final Style is because I'm ready to head over to JavaScript and start learning about proper interactivity of websites. And because I have spent too much time going back and forth and what programming area to do. I thought about starting JS today but decided to hold off and start tomorrow with leanring and using JS for web development. 

## Day 21 Learning JS || Starting the Programming Journey
After no programming for 2 days due to Oaks and Derby, I am now starting on JavaScript. Today I start with learning how to connect JS scripts to webpages, the use of the JavaScript console, the basic print statement of JS - consoe.log(). The morst improtan thing I learned today is that you do not need to use semicolons in JS. Which to me, is a breath of fresh air. Let's see how the journe goes for JavaScript.
