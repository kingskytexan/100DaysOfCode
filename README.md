# 100DaysOfCode
A collection of logs for doing the 100 Days of Code. 

Days 1 thru 4 are displayed in Instagram. The rest will be shown here.

## Day 5 - Learning CSS
Started to actual go into CSS. Went over fonts, colors, borders, and started on backgrounds. Learned about changing font families and applying size and line height. Went over the 3 ways to use color - name, RGB values and most importantly Hex values. Went over borders with their 3 parts - color, wwidth, and style. Started to go over backgrounds. Went over basic colors for backgrounds and how to apply images. Using no-repeat to not repeat the image and center center/cover to center the image and to display the full image if it's a large or small one.

## Day 6 - Learning CSS II
Wrapped up understanding backgrounds with learning the attachment propety so you can have an image be fixed onto the background. Started going over one of the most important parts of CSS - the Box Model. This provides the proper spacing around your elements and their borders. You have your given element, then padding between it and it's border. After that, you have you margin spacing around the border of the element itself. SLeanred the theory, but will learn the proper usage tomorrow.
