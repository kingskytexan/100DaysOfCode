# 100DaysOfCode
A collection of logs for doing the 100 Days of Code. 

Days 1 thru 4 are displayed in Instagram. The rest will be shown here.

## Day 5 - Learning CSS
Started to actual go into CSS. Went over fonts, colors, borders, and started on backgrounds. Learned about changing font families and applying size and line height. Went over the 3 ways to use color - name, RGB values and most importantly Hex values. Went over borders with their 3 parts - color, wwidth, and style. Started to go over backgrounds. Went over basic colors for backgrounds and how to apply images. Using no-repeat to not repeat the image and center center/cover to center the image and to display the full image if it's a large or small one.

## Day 6 - Learning CSS II
Wrapped up understanding backgrounds with learning the attachment propety so you can have an image be fixed onto the background. Started going over one of the most important parts of CSS - the Box Model. This provides the proper spacing around your elements and their borders. You have your given element, then padding between it and it's border. After that, you have you margin spacing around the border of the element itself. SLeanred the theory, but will learn the proper usage tomorrow.

## Day 7 - Learning CSS III
Finished up learning about the box model of margins and padding. Applying values to all sides, combining like values for top and bottom with left and right. Went over alignment in CSS. Learned the use of the container class with a max-width and auto margins are used to center your various boxes. Learned the tex align property to align my text in anyway that I need; mainly used center. Learned about the basic float, before learning about using CSS grid and flex box. When you float something, need to remember to set a width with percentage, and set the box sizing to border-box to prevent combining of values. And ended with, always remember to clear your floats to prevent the overlapping of elements. 

## Day 8 - Learning CSS IV
Learned about styling links and buttons and that there will be times to style links as buttons using btn as the class name. Went over styling and setting up navigation menus. When doing an overall nav menu with floats, rememebr to use the overflow propety so the floats do not collapse the background. 

## Day 9 - Hotel BT
Started on the first HTML and CSS project called Hotel BT. This project using basic HTML and CSS nothing special. Added the project images to the project folder. Created the 3 HTML pages used for the project - index, about and contact. Added the main CSS style sheet called main that will hold all the main styling for the project. Created the HTML and the CSS for the logo that will link to the homepage andthe navigation menu to the 3 different pages of the website.

## Day 10 - Hotel BT II
Worked on the Showcase, Home info and Features sections for the website. Created the HMTL for these sections along with JS script to Font Awesome to use their icons. Created thier CSS rules for these sections minus Features. Having these sections, will have their own styling rules while also having utility classes that I will use throughout the project. Doing project like this shows me a better understanding of HTML and vanilla CSS and how to use them. With more projects, will provide a better understanding of web development.

## Day 11 - Hotel BT III
Styled the features section of the homepage. Used floats on the box div's while providing padding and background colors to the boxes. Created the HTML for the footer section and added the CSS for the footer section. Centered the text in the footer while also adding text color and background color. Added the clr class to clear the floats from the boxes so that the spacing for the background in the footer gets its given size. Gotta love the the use of floats and the clearing of the floats.
