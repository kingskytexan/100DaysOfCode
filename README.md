# 100DaysOfCode
A collection of logs for doing the 100 Days of Code. 

Days 1 thru 4 are displayed in Instagram. The rest will be shown here.

## Day 5 - Learning CSS
Started to actual go into CSS. Went over fonts, colors, borders, and started on backgrounds. Learned about changing font families and applying size and line height. Went over the 3 ways to use color - name, RGB values and most importantly Hex values. Went over borders with their 3 parts - color, wwidth, and style. Started to go over backgrounds. Went over basic colors for backgrounds and how to apply images. Using no-repeat to not repeat the image and center center/cover to center the image and to display the full image if it's a large or small one.

## Day 6 - Learning CSS II
Wrapped up understanding backgrounds with learning the attachment propety so you can have an image be fixed onto the background. Started going over one of the most important parts of CSS - the Box Model. This provides the proper spacing around your elements and their borders. You have your given element, then padding between it and it's border. After that, you have you margin spacing around the border of the element itself. SLeanred the theory, but will learn the proper usage tomorrow.

## Day 7 - Learning CSS III
Finished up learning about the box model of margins and padding. Applying values to all sides, combining like values for top and bottom with left and right. Went over alignment in CSS. Learned the use of the container class with a max-width and auto margins are used to center your various boxes. Learned the tex align property to align my text in anyway that I need; mainly used center. Learned about the basic float, before learning about using CSS grid and flex box. When you float something, need to remember to set a width with percentage, and set the box sizing to border-box to prevent combining of values. And ended with, always remember to clear your floats to prevent the overlapping of elements. 

## Day 8 - Learning CSS IV
Learned about styling links and buttons and that there will be times to style links as buttons using btn as the class name. Went over styling and setting up navigation menus. When doing an overall nav menu with floats, rememebr to use the overflow propety so the floats do not collapse the background. 

## Day 9 - Hotel BT
Started on the first HTML and CSS project called Hotel BT. This project using basic HTML and CSS nothing special. Added the project images to the project folder. Created the 3 HTML pages used for the project - index, about and contact. Added the main CSS style sheet called main that will hold all the main styling for the project. Created the HTML and the CSS for the logo that will link to the homepage andthe navigation menu to the 3 different pages of the website.

## Day 10 - Hotel BT II
Worked on the Showcase, Home info and Features sections for the website. Created the HMTL for these sections along with JS script to Font Awesome to use their icons. Created thier CSS rules for these sections minus Features. Having these sections, will have their own styling rules while also having utility classes that I will use throughout the project. Doing project like this shows me a better understanding of HTML and vanilla CSS and how to use them. With more projects, will provide a better understanding of web development.

## Day 11 - Hotel BT III
Styled the features section of the homepage. Used floats on the box div's while providing padding and background colors to the boxes. Created the HTML for the footer section and added the CSS for the footer section. Centered the text in the footer while also adding text color and background color. Added the clr class to clear the floats from the boxes so that the spacing for the background in the footer gets its given size. Gotta love the the use of floats and the clearing of the floats.

## Day 12 - Hotel BT - Final
Finally wrapped up the Hotel Bt website. I completed the HTML and CSS for the about and contact page. Doing this project has shown how to create a simple website. Shows the general way of doing websote developement. Even though, the CSS was simple CSS with floats which make its interesting. The pages use alot of the same parts and classes, which makes it easier for devleoping the site. The more practice I get form these projects, will help to understand web development and with the devleopment itself.

## Day 13 - Responsive Design
Started on the section for Responsive Design. Anytime you build a website add or app, you need to think of the different screen sizes that will run saide site and app. Learned the Mobile First method to learning repsonsive redesgin. Learned what nedia queries and how to use them. Besides setting a max-width, you can also set min-width, min-height, and max-height. You can also set a media to be a screen size between a max-width and min-width. On a seprate ote, got a newer iPAd at work since we are doing away with Apple products. 

## Day 14 - Bowling
Nothing wrong with hanging out with friends who are family. It's needed.

## Day 15 - Responsive Design II
Went over the different units used in reponsive design - em, rem, viewport height/vh and viewport width/vw. Rem are relative units based on the root element. The root element that is used is the HTML element. The given pixels the root element uses is 16 pixels. Rem is ahwole lot esier to use and understand then using em units. Em units is based on the sizing of the parent element/container. Using em units can cause issues with spacing and sizing for nested elements. Vh units and Vw units both have 100 per browser. VH is the most common of the 2 since you will laways have websites going across the screen. Vh units are also great with the creation and styling of landing pages. Understanding these provide a better understanding with media queries to understand and use responsive design. 

## Day 16 Hotel BT IV / Flexbox Design
After learning abiout responsive design, the Hoel BT project got resposnive for screen sizes that are tablet size and smaller. Added a mobile css file, which includes all of the responsive style rules for the smaller queen size. Added a media attribute of screena and max-width of 768 pixels, for the screen sizes. Basically lessened spacing of the margins and padding for the smaller screen sizes, removed floats so the tiems would be stacked neatly, added some bottrom border lines for the different list items, and when items are stacked made sure their widths would be 100% across the screen. After that, I went of the first mondern CSS layout known as flex box. Flex box or flex for short, replaces floats to center items along the main and cross axis of the flex container. You can set flex items to wrap to the next line when the screen is smaller. You can set flex itmes to shrink when the scree gets smaller. You can also set the flex items to fill the width and or ehight of the flex container by setting it's grow. The geeral idea of the flex box is an amazing one. Next step, is to create a project that will show flex in action along with provide a better understanding of flex box.
